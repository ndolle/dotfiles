2015-11-09 16:23:15	pitts	the United States is exceptional in that it was founded on a set of republican ideals, rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address, America is a nation "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"

2015-11-09 16:40:11	pitts	American exceptionalism is the theory that the United States is inherently different from other nations.[2] In this view, American exceptionalism stems from its emergence from the American Revolution, thereby becoming what political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset called "the first new nation"[3] and developing a uniquely American ideology, "Americanism", based on liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, republicanism, democracy and laissez-faire.

2015-11-10 10:37:36	anderton	I preordered the steam controller today (nov. 9) and rocket league popped up so thats fine. But i already have portal 2, so i was wondering if i can return portal 2 without giving it as a gift to someone. But if im forced to give it as a gift, is it possible to give it away to a fake account i make, and then return it there? Because i really want the money and i dont want to give it to some one 
2015-11-10 10:37:37	anderton	else, and i want the money.
2015-11-10 10:39:23	apples_	anderton: do you have <2 hours on portal 2

2015-11-10 16:44:43	Hats	haha wow
2015-11-10 16:44:58	BobFromMarketing	So I actually had a peak at the late game
2015-11-10 16:45:09	Gumpin	you kill your son or nuke the city
2015-11-10 16:45:11	Gumpin	?
2015-11-10 16:45:20	BobFromMarketing	Nah not that late
2015-11-10 16:45:47	Livonian	your son is a robot and is the final boss
2015-11-10 16:45:52	BobFromMarketing	cool
2015-11-10 16:46:00	BobFromMarketing	I dont give a fuck about the story in a fallout game
2015-11-10 16:46:07	BobFromMarketing	Im playing farmville nigga
2015-11-10 16:46:19	Livonian	skyrim with guns
2015-11-10 16:46:25	BobFromMarketing	Basically
2015-11-10 16:46:28	Gumpin	skyrim with guns is good
2015-11-10 16:46:31	Gumpin	i heard the map is small tho
2015-11-10 16:46:35	Gumpin	11 minutes cross time
2015-11-10 16:46:42	Gumpin	thats like
2015-11-10 16:46:43	BobFromMarketing	I sure hope not
2015-11-10 16:46:44	Gumpin	less than 3
2015-11-10 16:46:52	charlottes-work	how much is falls out
2015-11-10 16:46:55	charlottes-work	falls out 4
2015-11-10 16:46:56	Gumpin	dunno
2015-11-10 16:47:01	Gumpin	skyrim was 2hr crossing time
2015-11-10 16:47:03	Gumpin	on foot
2015-11-10 16:47:15	Livonian	fallout is like 11 minutes
2015-11-10 16:47:17	Livonian	or something
2015-11-10 16:47:23	BobFromMarketing	e. The actual amount of time it'll take players to cross from one side of the map to the other will vary wildly, depending on which route is taken and how many enemies stand in their way, but running straight from outside Vault 111 to the opposite corner of the map took us just under 20 minutes. You can see the entire run (minus enemy encounters) at 500 percent speed in the video below:
2015-11-10 16:47:25	BobFromMarketing	20 
2015-11-10 16:47:32	BobFromMarketing	So about the same size as skyrim
2015-11-10 16:47:36	Gumpin	skyrim is 2 hrs
2015-11-10 16:47:43	BobFromMarketing	Only reason skyrim is 2 hours is because of the GIANT GODDAMN MOUNTAINS
2015-11-10 16:47:46	BobFromMarketing	If you run across the top edge
2015-11-10 16:47:47	Gumpin	yeah but
2015-11-10 16:47:49	BobFromMarketing	its like 10-15 minutes
2015-11-10 16:47:51	Gumpin	that's a legit thing :P
2015-11-10 16:47:57	Gumpin	the mountains force you to see the map
2015-11-10 16:48:08	Gumpin	although saying its the same size as a game 4 years ago
2015-11-10 16:48:15	BobFromMarketing	Also in this one you can settle most of the map
2015-11-10 16:48:25	Gumpin	that is kinda neat
2015-11-10 16:48:29	Gumpin	the little RUST style base making
2015-11-10 16:48:34	Livonian	also in this one there is literally nothing for 80% of the map
2015-11-10 16:48:39	Gumpin	but still no multiplayer

2015-11-10 16:49:09	Gumpin	what would be perfect is if you took fallout 3's inside the city density of content
2015-11-10 16:49:15	Gumpin	and made it an entire skyrim sized map
2015-11-10 16:49:20	Gumpin	it would make for a massive fuck off game
2015-11-10 16:49:21	Gumpin	but come on
2015-11-10 16:49:23	Livonian	or alternatively
2015-11-10 16:49:28	Gumpin	some games are 100 gigs now
2015-11-10 16:49:30	Livonian	if bethesda learned how to develop
2015-11-10 16:49:32	Livonian	technically
2015-11-10 16:49:36	Gumpin	they fired that long ago
2015-11-10 16:49:40	Gumpin	now its modders
2015-11-10 16:50:21	BobFromMarketing	Ill always like elder scrolls more than fallout
2015-11-10 16:50:25	BobFromMarketing	but I like fallout 
2015-11-10 16:50:50	Gumpin	if you could get more weapon variety into elder scrolls
2015-11-10 16:50:53	Livonian	elder scrolls world is always cooler
2015-11-10 16:50:58	Gumpin	than just slash slash slash slash blunt blunt arrow
2015-11-10 16:51:19	Livonian	the brown/grey bland boring middle america wasteland doesnt do it for me
2015-11-10 16:51:32	Gumpin	fallout 4 is supposed to be boston
2015-11-10 16:51:36	Gumpin	dunno why its not baltimore
2015-11-10 16:51:39	Gumpin	no editing needed
2015-11-10 16:51:41	Gumpin	just use RL pics
2015-11-10 16:51:54	Gumpin	will still have the brown/grey textures too

2015-11-13 02:18:00	&el_digin	As the National Union of Students’ Women’s conference opened yesterday, delegates were asked to replace applause with ‘feminist jazz hands’.
2015-11-13 02:18:00	&el_digin	The request came from the Twitter feed of the Oxford University Student Union’s Women’s Campaign (@womcam) – it claimed clapping was ‘triggering anxiety’. This latest safe-space policy requested attendees refrain from applauding motions that included calls to ‘end transphobia, biphobia, and Islamophobia on campus’.

The rapid and successful deployment of the Stackless IO component and the EVE64 migration presented such a sudden and significant ascent to the very edge of technology that it was only fitting to name this expansion QUANTUM RISE.

2015-11-13 15:13:53	anderton	Ships which have fleet hangars are currently able to scoop drones into this hangar regardless of the drones state. This can result in drones being scooped under circumstances where it shouldnt be possible, such as when theyre under active control of another pilot. This issue does not affect any other items, only drones.
2015-11-13 15:13:53	anderton	Scooping drones in this manner is an exploit. Any abuse of this exploit will carry consequences, dont do this.
2015-11-13 15:13:53	anderton	A fix for this issue is being worked on and will be deployed in the near future. Until the fix is deployed, we suggest scooping drones to a ships cargo hold as an alternative which wont result in accidental abuse of this issue.

2015-11-13 15:43:46	pitts	For stand-up comedians, rising concerns about students’ reactions to potentially sensitive subjects—like those that have roiled the University of Missouri and Yale University this week—are no joke.
2015-11-13 15:43:46	pitts	Stars such as Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld have said they don’t play college shows anymore because the audiences are too easily offended. Schools now often have contracts that forbid performers from using certain words or even broaching entire subjects.
2015-11-13 15:43:46	pitts	Many comedians find it ironic that the venues that gave birth to social movements and comedy legends such as George Carlin are becoming too squeamish for their material. Performers who depend on schools for their livelihood—a gig generally pays between $1,000 and $2,000—say they work with ever greater caution.

2015-11-13 16:28:25	Kazanir	despite building os x on top of free software lmao
2015-11-13 16:28:25	pitts	Absolutely. It could be distributed in source code form with a license that does not include Open Source provisions. That would still be side-loadable, and there would be (admittedly kind of toothless) provisions against derivative works and resale.
2015-11-13 16:28:26	pitts	That's not what f.lux did here.
2015-11-13 16:28:34	Kazanir	Good job copy pasting
2015-11-13 16:28:47	Kazanir	Let me make a list of non-open-source projects where the source code is distributed

2015-11-13 16:28:51	Kazanir	Short list.
2015-11-13 16:29:13	pitts	they should have no problems doing so since its a free app with no business model
2015-11-13 16:29:22	Kazanir	.........
2015-11-13 16:29:52	Kazanir	Does apple distribute the source code to Safari
2015-11-13 16:29:56	Kazanir	which is a free app with no business model
2015-11-13 16:29:59	Kazanir	Answer: They do not.
2015-11-13 16:30:00	pitts	but if they were hoping there would be some kind of public backlash cause of this then lol
2015-11-13 16:30:08	pitts	apple is completely right to shut it down

2015-11-16 20:10:48	&leetcheese	regarding your question earlier
2015-11-16 20:10:50	pitts	oh
2015-11-16 20:10:51	&leetcheese	i was in a meeting sorry
2015-11-16 20:10:58	&leetcheese	its all internal
2015-11-16 20:11:12	pitts	what about when im using icloud services
2015-11-16 20:11:17	BMK2	did you decide to get into insider trading yet leetcheese 
2015-11-16 20:11:19	pitts	theres no way to see that it goes to IBM servers?
2015-11-16 20:11:22	&leetcheese	no
2015-11-16 20:11:54	&leetcheese	there are many layers in front of their storage
2015-11-16 20:12:09	pitts	so does apple use aws or azure anymore
2015-11-16 20:12:19	&leetcheese	im sure some projects do
2015-11-16 20:12:26	&leetcheese	also they may use aws for prototyping

2015-11-16 20:13:07	&leetcheese	before they used a lot of netapp too
2015-11-16 20:13:14	&leetcheese	but thats all gone afaik
2015-11-16 20:13:27	pitts	also what does apple use all their datacenters they've built the last couple of years for
2015-11-16 20:13:45	&leetcheese	providing their own cloud afaik
2015-11-16 20:13:53	&leetcheese	they put a lot of work into docker

2015-11-16 20:14:43	&leetcheese	i shouldn't talk about it anyways
2015-11-16 20:14:44	pitts	i wonder if apple will use watson to make siri better
2015-11-16 20:14:54	&leetcheese	that would be cool
2015-11-16 20:14:59	pitts	its ok its not insider trading if we dont trade on the info
2015-11-16 20:15:05	&leetcheese	i would think you'd see watson in healthkit anyways
2015-11-16 20:15:14	&leetcheese	since ibm is doing a lot of focus with watson + healthcare
2015-11-16 20:15:22	&leetcheese	makes sense to me too
2015-11-16 20:15:27	&leetcheese	take over the webmd space
2015-11-16 20:15:33	&leetcheese	+ apple watch realtime info
2015-11-16 20:16:11	&leetcheese	im not worried about the insider trading aspect
2015-11-16 20:16:18	&leetcheese	just they say don't talk about it
2015-11-16 20:16:20	&leetcheese	and im a fool
2015-11-16 20:16:35	&leetcheese	you know how secretive they are
2015-11-16 20:16:40	&leetcheese	remember when the guy lost the iphone?
2015-11-16 20:16:43	pitts	yea

2015-11-16 20:21:02	pitts	like did they start using ibm cloud at around this time
2015-11-16 20:21:12	pitts	cause then it would kind of make sense
2015-11-16 20:21:22	pitts	causee this partnership always seemed lopsided

2015-11-16 20:22:20	pitts	oh
2015-11-16 20:22:36	&leetcheese	so its good for ibm in that aspect
2015-11-16 20:22:43	pitts	i thought u meant that apple brought over their existing cloud business. like instead of using s3 or w/e for hosting photos in icloud
2015-11-16 20:22:44	&leetcheese	as it deepens the tie to apple through the aquisition 
2015-11-16 20:22:49	pitts	it got moved to IBM
2015-11-16 20:22:54	&leetcheese	well it got moved to my company
2015-11-16 20:22:56	&leetcheese	which is now ibm
2015-11-16 20:23:03	&leetcheese	so kinda the same
2015-11-16 20:23:37	pitts	idgi was ur startup in the same business as AWS
2015-11-16 20:23:52	pitts	like offering cloud services

2015-11-16 20:24:18	&leetcheese	we offer 100% s3 api compatability with larger scalability and less cost
2015-11-16 20:24:43	pitts	but whos datacenters were being used
2015-11-16 20:24:51	pitts	amazon?

2015-11-16 20:24:57	pitts	oh
2015-11-16 20:25:23	pitts	so maybe they did start to bring icloud in house?

2015-11-16 20:25:42	&leetcheese	that they do

2015-11-16 20:25:48	&leetcheese	the problem is

2015-11-16 20:26:41	pitts	is it still more expensive even with whatever discount they can get for their volume
2015-11-16 20:26:48	&leetcheese	yes
2015-11-16 20:26:52	pitts	ah
2015-11-16 20:27:14	&leetcheese	also if apple bought dark fiber it really brings transit costs down too
2015-11-16 20:27:24	&leetcheese	aws and google bought a ton of fiber and apple was late to the game

2015-11-16 20:28:17	pitts	so ur startup wasnt doing the hosting, it just made the technology for them to use in their own datacecnters?

2015-11-16 20:29:55	&leetcheese	and neither do i :)
2015-11-16 20:30:15	&leetcheese	ive had easier time getting diagnostic data out of the government or lockheed martin
2015-11-16 20:30:21	pitts	AWS is getting huge contracts though
2015-11-16 20:30:25	pitts	like netflix is on AWS
2015-11-16 20:30:30	pitts	CIA gave them a contract
2015-11-16 20:30:36	pitts	whicch ibm sued about lol
2015-11-16 20:30:42	&leetcheese	netflix does everythign with aws because their storage cost isn't that big
2015-11-16 20:30:48	&leetcheese	most of netflix is ec2 for transcoding
2015-11-16 20:31:07	&leetcheese	all of netflix's heavy data use is handled by the CDNs 
2015-11-16 20:31:08	&leetcheese	the dataset is small, like 1PB
2015-11-16 20:31:18	pitts	ah

2015-11-16 20:31:24	&leetcheese	and the data locality there is what matters

2015-11-16 20:46:35	&leetcheese	yeah i think netflix's whole problem is that they use EC2 heavily

2015-11-16 20:47:05	pitts	As other have speculated, the media bits all come from Netflix designed and implemented "Open Connect" servers, either in facilities that we have leased, or in space within ISPs own facilities.
2015-11-16 20:47:05	pitts	AWS provides a robust, distributed environment for our compute and storage requirements.  It provides a high level of infrastructure abstraction that supports building sophisticated automated operational control.  Because we take advantage of the elastic features, we achieve high rates of utilization around 50%.  It is very cost effective.
2015-11-16 20:47:56	&leetcheese	it probably is
2015-11-16 20:47:59	Sabine	netflix needs lots of data transfer capacity everywhere but not really any processing power
2015-11-16 20:48:01	&leetcheese	netflix doesn't have an equal load

2015-11-16 21:25:48	MadzNegro	is it a lease or purchase?
2015-11-16 21:25:54	&el_digin	cash purchase
2015-11-16 21:25:57	MadzNegro	if it's a lease dealers usually bend over backwards to give you good service
2015-11-16 21:26:03	MadzNegro	because they want you to keep leasing
2015-11-16 21:26:26	&el_digin	they offered me a lease but they were bullshitting me with the cost of everything
2015-11-16 21:26:42	MadzNegro	leases are generally better unless you're going to be putting on a bunch of miles

2015-11-16 21:27:39	pitts	other than how much storage u want
2015-11-16 21:27:45	&el_digin	leasing is typically pricier
2015-11-16 21:27:54	pitts	16gb, 64gb, or 128gb
2015-11-16 21:27:54	MadzNegro	el_digin: not really
2015-11-16 21:28:27	MadzNegro	i've got a higher end lease and i pay like 250/month
2015-11-16 21:28:39	&el_digin	i can see leasing like a bmw or something
2015-11-16 21:28:43	&el_digin	because they throw in maintenance
2015-11-16 21:28:51	&el_digin	i havent crunched the numbers though
2015-11-16 21:29:00	MadzNegro	i mean cars are a depreciating investment anyways
2015-11-16 21:29:03	&el_digin	ya
2015-11-16 21:29:18	MadzNegro	i end up paying around 5k over the 2 years of the lease
2015-11-16 21:29:33	MadzNegro	entry level car purchase is like 20-30kish, right?
2015-11-16 21:29:47	&el_digin	deprecation over 10 years depending on the car is 20k
2015-11-16 21:29:50	&el_digin	ish
2015-11-16 21:29:53	MadzNegro	yeah
2015-11-16 21:29:59	&el_digin	so its about the same
2015-11-16 21:30:02	MadzNegro	exactly
2015-11-16 21:30:20	MadzNegro	except i've got a v8 hemi charger with 4wd
2015-11-16 21:30:24	MadzNegro	which would sell for much more
2015-11-16 21:30:27	&el_digin	i dont think you can get a lease for $250 in canada though
2015-11-16 21:30:38	MadzNegro	you actually get better rates on the higher end cars because they have a better resale at the end of the lease
2015-11-16 21:30:47	&el_digin	financing in the states is so much better for some reason
2015-11-16 21:30:52	MadzNegro	huh
2015-11-16 21:31:00	&el_digin	and cars are so much cheaper
2015-11-16 21:31:08	MadzNegro	yeah it basically breaks even for me but i get a new car every two years
2015-11-16 21:31:13	pitts	more competition
2015-11-16 21:31:15	MadzNegro	and generally get to get full options
2015-11-16 21:31:26	MadzNegro	instead of having the same car for 8-10 years
2015-11-16 21:31:34	MadzNegro	then have to deal with selling it to recoup the cost if i want a new one

The report and responses amount to 828 pages. I’ve now had a chance to read the documents in full. And I suspect the C.I.A. was treated unfairly.

2015-11-16 22:35:46	pitts	But while the committee’s framing may be understandable as a political matter, it was a mistake as a matter of historical accuracy and of moral principle. The report is, to date, the closest thing to official accountability that we have. But by focusing on whether the program worked and whether the C.I.A. lied, the report was critically misleading. Responsibility for the program lies not with the C.I.A. alone, but also with everyone else, up to the highest level

2015-11-16 22:43:49	Talbrys_Narentyr	Healing power increase by Influence level has been increased. That means that as you scale up Influence levels with a Companion they will get more powerful per level than before. This helps to offset the base healing reduction a bit as you gain influence with your companion.

2015-11-16 22:44:20	Talbrys_Narentyr	There isn’t a flat % that healing was reduced by. Effectiveness reduction varies greatly depending on level, Influence, level sync, etc. That being said, the healer companions are still quite competitive, but they no longer trivialize content that was meant to be challenging.

2015-11-16 23:29:50	pitts	Since the early 2000s (decade), El Al has been the only commercial airliner to fit its planes with systems to defend against anti-aircraft missiles. More recently, El Al has began to fit some of its planes (which fly on more sensitive routes) with an updated system missile defense system that employs an infrared missile-tracking camera, an “infrared (IR), ultra-violet (UV), or radar missile-approach warning (MAWS) sensor to detect a missile launch in the ver

"C-MUSIC is one of the biggest and most complex projects ever undertaken at Elbit and in Israel".[53]
2015-11-16 23:31:04	pitts	LOL
2015-11-16 23:31:05	pitts	The Israeli president Shimon Peres, opted at the last minute to change his flight from El Al to Air Canada during a state visit, because El Al tried to charge the president a $5,000 excess baggage fee for an oxygen tank. According to protocol, it is mandatory for an oxygen tank and other medical equipment to be on board an aircraft whenever an Israeli president or prime minister flies abroad.[63]

2015-11-16 23:34:05	+Fin1712	Passengers are asked to report three hours before departure. All El Al terminals around the world[citation needed] are closely monitored for security. There are plain-clothes agents and fully armed police or military personnel patrolling the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be 
2015-11-16 23:34:06	+Fin1712	interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers will be asked questions about where they are coming from, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. El Al believes interviewers can spot signs of nervousness.[54]
2015-11-16 23:34:06	+Fin1712	At the check-in counter, passengers' passports and tickets are closely examined. A ticket without a sticker from the security checkers will not be accepted. At passport control passengers' names are checked against information from the FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber 
2015-11-16 23:34:10	+Fin1712	simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives.[55] Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, even if they are supervised by government or private security firms
2015-11-16 23:34:27	+Fin1712	Undercover agents (sometimes referred to as sky marshals) carrying concealed firearms sit among the passengers on every international El Al flight.

2016-01-13 16:01:53	doublestep	It's been a fetish of mine to see women dying beautifully, meaning it has to be a certain death like hanging, or getting stabbed (making the beauty of the face still intact). I don't know how I got that fetish but ever since I discovered guro, I've been living in heaven. Some guro are disgusting though, so it's still kind of hard to find something that I want.

2016-01-14 09:49:35	progodlegend	why use the numbers 300,000,000 in the previous sentence
2016-01-14 09:49:36	charlottes-web	morning
2016-01-14 09:49:43	progodlegend	but spell out 270,000,000 in the next sentence
2016-01-14 09:49:43	--	You are now known as charlotte-work
2016-01-14 09:49:45	progodlegend	wtf
2016-01-14 09:49:55	apples	progodlegend, they are rounding up
2016-01-14 09:50:01	apples	like how 270mil is rounded up from 150mil
2016-01-14 09:50:03	apples	))
2016-01-14 09:50:11	Calmoto	progodlegend invented skype first
2016-01-14 09:50:12	anderton-lauren	almost none
2016-01-14 09:50:19	anderton-lauren	because they ran out of addresses
2016-01-14 09:50:45	+LuciaDenniard	>built the critically acclaimed MOBA Fates Forever.
2016-01-14 09:50:45	apples	oh, over 4 billion
2016-01-14 09:50:46	progodlegend	so how does teamspeak make money?
2016-01-14 09:50:53	anderton-lauren	licensing
2016-01-14 09:50:55	+LuciaDenniard	you have to pay for ts3 server licenses
2016-01-14 09:50:56	apples	selling TS servers probably
2016-01-14 09:50:57	anderton-lauren	ts3 is hosted only
2016-01-14 09:51:07	progodlegend	ok so how do discord servers work currently?
2016-01-14 09:51:08	anderton-lauren	that's why everyone/goon moved to mumble instead of ts3
2016-01-14 09:51:12	+LuciaDenniard	discord's just free
2016-01-14 09:51:20	progodlegend	so how will they make money?
2016-01-14 09:51:25	+LuciaDenniard	who knows
2016-01-14 09:51:25	velyks_	Its going to be Ad-supported
2016-01-14 09:51:28	+LuciaDenniard	that's why I am suspicious as fuck
2016-01-14 09:51:34	velyks_	when they run out of investor money
2016-01-14 09:51:35	progodlegend	lul
2016-01-14 09:51:39	anderton-lauren	nobody really gives that much thought
2016-01-14 09:51:39	apples	maybe its a front for the LGBT Mafia
2016-01-14 09:51:45	anderton-lauren	they just go omg it's free forever *smug*
2016-01-14 09:51:53	apples	tbh fam
2016-01-14 09:51:55	velyks_	You can get a non-profit 512 user TS3 license if you jump through a million hoops
2016-01-14 09:51:56	+LuciaDenniard	if it was open source
2016-01-14 09:51:57	anderton-lauren	never mind the fact that the audio quality is garbage tier
2016-01-14 09:51:58	apples	they decided
2016-01-14 09:51:59	+LuciaDenniard	then alright
2016-01-14 09:52:04	apples	"we are going to make the next big thing and get rich"
2016-01-14 09:52:13	apples	without thinking about the in-between of translating making a thing
2016-01-14 09:52:14	apples	into getting rich
2016-01-14 09:52:24	velyks_	The audio is garbage, the chat system is awful, there are no sub channels and other shit
2016-01-14 09:52:32	apples	but the interface tho
2016-01-14 09:52:34	+LuciaDenniard	why would you start a business and not have a plan to make money?
2016-01-14 09:52:35	+LuciaDenniard	fuck
2016-01-14 09:52:38	progodlegend	I've never associated this sentence "we are going to make the next big thing and get rich" with niche PC gaming clans, but I guess there's a first for everything
2016-01-14 09:52:42	apples	its not a business
2016-01-14 09:52:44	apples	its a STARTUP
2016-01-14 09:52:54	velyks_	They're currently running off of investor funds
2016-01-14 09:52:55	+LuciaDenniard	I bet it's even in san francisco
2016-01-14 09:52:58	velyks_	That'll dry up
2016-01-14 09:53:23	progodlegend	idk TMC seems to be going steady with VC for the moment
2016-01-14 09:53:33	+LuciaDenniard	TMC actually has adverts on though
2016-01-14 09:53:37	Calmoto	tech bubble burst is coming like a hardon boyz
2016-01-14 09:53:39	+LuciaDenniard	they have a beter business model than discord
2016-01-14 09:53:41	Calmoto	sell apple stock now
2016-01-14 09:53:49	apples	lol
2016-01-14 09:53:52	apples	LuciaDenniard, anderton-lauren: In their comparison
2016-01-14 09:53:59	apples	discord is basically identical to TS
2016-01-14 09:54:12	progodlegend	nah discord is cool
2016-01-14 09:54:15	progodlegend	it has a borderless window
2016-01-14 09:54:16	anderton-lauren	yeah but they have the codec turned down to like
2016-01-14 09:54:16	progodlegend	I like that
2016-01-14 09:54:18	anderton-lauren	tin can and string
2016-01-14 09:54:20	velyks_	Apparently the new version of Mumble is going to come with a theme that doesn't make it look like Windows 95
2016-01-14 09:54:23	progodlegend	reminds me of windows 8 tiles
2016-01-14 09:54:24	apples	except a) not free, b) no "browser support", c) no push notifs, d) no "automatic failover"
2016-01-14 09:54:25	apples	so
2016-01-14 09:54:26	progodlegend	that's fresh
2016-01-14 09:54:28	apples	identical to TS
2016-01-14 09:54:34	anderton-lauren	tmc seemed pretty rudderless from my editor perspective
2016-01-14 09:54:37	anderton-lauren	which is why i left

2016-01-14 09:55:01	velyks_	Why would you want browser support?
2016-01-14 09:55:04	charlotte-work	tmc is fucking terrible
2016-01-14 09:55:09	velyks_	cos ur a millenial pleb?
2016-01-14 09:55:13	charlotte-work	the content is grim
2016-01-14 09:55:14	apples	velyks_: it's their way of turning web-based into a "benefit"
2016-01-14 09:55:30	anderton-lauren	'can we hire more writers pls' '*silence*' 'help' '*silence*' 'HEY WHY IS THERE NO NEW CONTENT'
2016-01-14 09:55:39	+LuciaDenniard	my ts3 server automatically fails over
2016-01-14 09:55:49	+LuciaDenniard	it just takes 2 hours for DNS to propogate
2016-01-14 09:55:50	velyks_	My ts3 server automatically fails
2016-01-14 09:56:01	apples	man
2016-01-14 09:56:04	apples	i had a TS once
2016-01-14 09:56:17	apples	then they cancelled my service after trying to charge me twice and I paid once
2016-01-14 09:56:25	velyks_	nah jus joking. No point in having HA with something thats got no SLAs and isn't being paid for
2016-01-14 09:56:31	apples	so i told them 2 go fuck themselves and havnt gone back since
2016-01-14 09:56:32	apples	))
2016-01-14 09:56:43	apples	thx bluefang
2016-01-14 09:56:46	velyks_	Yeah I just pay for a dedicated server and host a non-profit license
2016-01-14 09:56:49	progodlegend	so teamspeak just sells licenses, they don't actually host your server for you?
2016-01-14 09:56:59	+LuciaDenniard	you can either buy a license, or pay to get it hosted for you
2016-01-14 09:57:02	velyks_	No, you have to go to a reseller that has bought a teamspeak license
2016-01-14 09:57:09	+LuciaDenniard	most EVE nerds host it themselves
2016-01-14 09:57:11	+LuciaDenniard	because fuck it
2016-01-14 09:57:14	velyks_	They dont sell licenses to individuals
2016-01-14 09:57:23	+LuciaDenniard	oh and that
2016-01-14 09:57:28	progodlegend	why not?
2016-01-14 09:57:31	progodlegend	what do they care
2016-01-14 09:57:32	velyks_	No point
2016-01-14 09:57:41	anderton-lauren	piracy
2016-01-14 09:57:42	velyks_	They sell licenses to reseller companies, teamspeak hosts etc.
2016-01-14 09:57:47	anderton-lauren	they don't want to give out the binaries to random scrubx

2016-01-14 14:53:43	anderton-lauren	yes because a military spec drone is going to cost the same as one that google and facebook want to fly to provide free internet to the third world

So I'm sitting there with three or four girls, waiting for my food, and I hear one of the chicks say, "You've got company." I'm like, "What the fuck?" Because my home is gated and shit. So I look up, and I see DJ Khaled waving his arms! I walked out there in disbelief — I had to snatch my ankle monitor out of the wall where it was charging — and I invited him in and had my c

2016-01-15 17:35:38	pitts	intel is dead
2016-01-15 17:35:41	nartel	lol
2016-01-15 17:35:54	nartel	you think arm is gonna beayt it lol?????
2016-01-15 17:35:59	pitts	it's intel's game to lose
2016-01-15 17:36:17	nartel	amds dead in the water if zen isnt 10/10 and its already rumoured to be haswell performance so worse than intels offerings
2016-01-15 17:36:26	nartel	and >ARM
2016-01-15 17:36:59	pitts	arm is good
2016-01-15 17:37:12	koahi	can confirm
2016-01-15 17:37:13	koahi	have 2
2016-01-15 17:37:13	nartel	not in a position to compete for a while
2016-01-15 17:37:32	pitts	why wouldnt amazon, facebook, google, microsoft start doing the designs for their needs in house
2016-01-15 17:37:35	pitts	using arm IP
2016-01-15 17:37:49	pitts	especially amazon
2016-01-15 17:37:55	pitts	who has the most incentive
2016-01-15 17:37:59	pitts	cause aws has huge scale

2016-01-15 17:38:53	burneddi	because designing your own chip isn't something a hosting company wants to do
2016-01-15 17:39:11	pitts	well when intel has 60% gross margins
2016-01-15 17:39:18	pitts	and like 99% of the server market share
2016-01-15 17:39:25	nartel	maybe in a few years then
2016-01-15 17:39:26	pitts	i think there are strong incentives
2016-01-15 17:39:42	pitts	why would a consumer electronics company like apple design its own chips
2016-01-15 17:39:47	pitts	instead of just buying them from intel
2016-01-15 17:40:42	nartel	arms a long way from desktop/server
2016-01-15 17:41:05	pitts	u sound like an incumbent
2016-01-15 17:41:23	nartel	it objectively does though
2016-01-15 17:41:24	burneddi	keep in mind it's not just a matter of slapping in a new ARM magic processor and suddenly your service is 50% cheaper because the evil intel is gone
2016-01-15 17:41:38	burneddi	there's a metric ton of software related woes you'll face
2016-01-15 17:41:41	burneddi	if you change architecture

2016-01-15 17:42:43	pitts	what software related woes
2016-01-15 17:42:51	pitts	doesnt linux work on arm
2016-01-15 17:42:53	nartel	everything being written in x86 lol
2016-01-15 17:43:07	burneddi	little things like software being compiled for x86_64 not working on arm at all
2016-01-15 17:43:40	burneddi	many linux distros do offer ARM binaries but enter proprietary solutions
2016-01-15 17:43:53	pitts	if ur entire competitive advantage is resting on that fact then i would say ur not in a fundamentally strong position
2016-01-15 17:44:14	nartel	well that and arm is at smartphone level not server yet
2016-01-15 17:44:34	pitts	also isnt that an amazon problem mostly
2016-01-15 17:44:40	pitts	to deal with
2016-01-15 17:44:42	burneddi	of course not, but it's a large discouraging factor for amazon/microsoft/google/facebook to start changing their datacenters to ARM
2016-01-15 17:44:49	pitts	does snapchat care
2016-01-15 17:44:55	pitts	when they make their app and put it on AWS
2016-01-15 17:44:55	burneddi	because they'd have to redo all their software
2016-01-15 17:45:19	burneddi	Yes they actually would
2016-01-15 17:45:23	garr_khan	anyone here german or read german?
2016-01-15 17:45:40	burneddi	users of AWS would have to make sure all their shit is ARM compatible too

2016-01-15 17:46:23	pitts	that they dont have to care about that stuff
2016-01-15 17:46:51	nartel	well as well as OS being compatible all software you run has to have an ARM version as well
2016-01-15 17:48:32	pitts	i dont like intel's prospects

2016-01-18 15:14:47	Lilith5	or like you work in a factory where you could get sucked into a machine and die
2016-01-18 15:15:17	brainfire	i would say don't do drugs if you'll get machined

2016-01-18 15:31:13	burneddi	Fallen: it just reinforces the already gay alt metagame in eve
2016-01-18 15:31:26	burneddi	actual new players probably won't use it very often
2016-01-18 15:31:27	&Fallen	gay alt metagame
2016-01-18 15:31:30	&Fallen	wtf
2016-01-18 15:31:48	&Fallen	what do u mean by this
2016-01-18 15:31:56	Don_Peyote	the reliance on alts
2016-01-18 15:32:00	burneddi	yeah you know that little part where everyone is playing at least 2-3 accounts at once and doing so gives them a massive competitive edge
2016-01-18 15:32:02	Don_Peyote	to compete/perform
2016-01-18 15:32:19	&Fallen	i mean yes
2016-01-18 15:32:20	Lilith5	so its like you inceminate your self with skills from a donor 
2016-01-18 15:32:22	&Fallen	falcons suck
2016-01-18 15:32:34	Lilith5	kind of kinky
2016-01-18 15:32:39	brainfire	now when you buy an alt it just won't have a retarded name and embarassin corp history
2016-01-18 15:32:44	brainfire	embarassing
2016-01-18 15:33:08	Lilith5	Some one some where is doing that with Lilith

2016-01-18 15:33:54	gigiarc	LuciaDenniard: fuk u m8
2016-01-18 15:34:01	brainfire	people should just use corpmates for cynos
2016-01-18 15:34:11	brainfire	and boosts
2016-01-18 15:34:12	burneddi	Fallen: I don't mean just straight up PvP alts used to kill you, it goes for virtually everything in the game. Wanna shoot rats? Either kill yourself because it's ridicilously shit, or get several alts which multiply your isk/hr and kill yourself because it's still shit.
2016-01-18 15:34:15	Lilith5	no thx
2016-01-18 15:34:25	burneddi	If you want to do industry you basically need a whole dedicated set of alts just for that
2016-01-18 15:34:33	&Fallen	but  burneddi thats p much every mmo tho
2016-01-18 15:34:36	brainfire	that's false
2016-01-18 15:34:38	+LuciaDenniard	gigiarc: rektm8
2016-01-18 15:34:57	Lilith5	if you do what I do and cyno around like 20 jumps in a week dont think any corpmate would do that
2016-01-18 15:34:59	brainfire	if you refuse to do anything unless you are in the top 2% of most-efficient doing it
2016-01-18 15:35:03	brainfire	THEN you have to have a bunch of alts
2016-01-18 15:35:07	burneddi	when I was playing WoW almost no one except neckbeard multiboxers paid for multiple accounts
2016-01-18 15:35:12	brainfire	if you are capable of having fun and not just turning it into a second job
2016-01-18 15:35:19	brainfire	you can do without
2016-01-18 15:35:22	gigiarc	lmao if you dont just buy plex or some shit
2016-01-18 15:35:24	gigiarc	fuck pve
2016-01-18 15:35:35	Sabine	hey i enjoyed isboxing incursions
2016-01-18 15:35:35	brainfire	unfortunately all the big names in eve are 2% nolife poopsockers
2016-01-18 15:35:41	&Fallen	Lineage 2 I use to roll around with 4 different dudes in tow
2016-01-18 15:35:42	Sabine	i unironically want to do it right now
2016-01-18 15:35:45	Sabine	and not even because of making isk
2016-01-18 15:35:52	Sabine	but because it is therapeutic
2016-01-18 15:36:03	burneddi	ok Fallen so what you meant to say that benefitting from multiple accounts is a characteristic of bad MMOs
2016-01-18 15:36:07	&Fallen	and wow is a bad example
2016-01-18 15:36:08	brainfire	and a big part of eve culture is shaming anyone who isn't a 2% nolife poopsocker
2016-01-18 15:36:20	&Fallen	repeccing and shit
2016-01-18 15:36:23	gigiarc	it looks like they backed off on the diminishing returns a bit
2016-01-18 15:36:27	gigiarc	on those sp injectors
2016-01-18 15:36:44	gigiarc	I think it was 20k for someone with 80million skill points
2016-01-18 15:36:46	gigiarc	in the last blog
2016-01-18 15:36:50	gigiarc	now its 150k
2016-01-18 15:37:06	brainfire	Specifically, we changed the 3rd bracket which used to give 200,000 to now give 300,000, and the final bracket which used to give 50,000 to 150,000.
2016-01-18 15:37:31	&Fallen	im saying that if you want to have multiple accounts you already can do so
2016-01-18 15:37:37	&Fallen	why make it aids
2016-01-18 15:38:23	Sabine	also skill trading is dumb because it removes the value of trained characters and replaces it with just farming whatever skills sell well
2016-01-18 15:38:49	Lilith5	probably it would cost a bunch of isk to trade though
2016-01-18 15:38:50	gigiarc	it's still more efficient to buy a full character
2016-01-18 15:38:55	gigiarc	if you want a lot of sp
2016-01-18 15:39:07	Lilith5	I bet the skill injector is about a plex then you pay another plex to inject the skill
2016-01-18 15:39:12	gigiarc	the injectors are good for a quick boost
2016-01-18 15:39:15	gigiarc	to finish a skill
2016-01-18 15:39:28	brainfire	yeah the really complex "gameplay of alt farming" cases seem like they'd be fucked by diminishing returns
2016-01-18 15:39:29	burneddi	Fallen: anyway I'm just complaining because I'm salty that Eve is a game where you have to pay for at least two subs so you can play other games while waiting for things to happen
2016-01-18 15:39:48	gigiarc	I only pay one sub
2016-01-18 15:39:59	gigiarc	since I dont mess with capitals anymore
2016-01-18 15:40:20	Lilith5	Horde caps not a thing?
2016-01-18 15:40:27	gigiarc	horde has caps
2016-01-18 15:40:32	gigiarc	I'm not in the cap group
2016-01-18 15:41:19	Lilith5	I was using caps in horde before they had a cap group lol

2016-01-18 15:41:48	burneddi	I wonder how many subs per actual player there are now anyway
2016-01-18 15:41:52	burneddi	pretty sure it's easily over 2
2016-01-18 15:42:02	Lilith5	2-3
2016-01-18 15:42:06	Calmoto1	REKTD MORE LIKE CUNTD
2016-01-18 15:42:09	&Fallen	i hear you 
2016-01-18 15:42:27	Calmoto1	ive fallen
2016-01-18 15:42:29	Calmoto1	and i cant get up
2016-01-18 15:42:31	Lilith5	Goons made a post about who is actually active per account and its like goons have only 1/3 activity per account
2016-01-18 15:42:58	Calmoto1	eve is dead thats why, and fozzie did the crime
2016-01-18 15:43:09	gigiarc	eve is actually good
2016-01-18 15:43:09	burneddi	euthanasia isn't a crime Calmoto1 
2016-01-18 15:43:14	Lilith5	so like if all alts in goons left it would be like 1000 people or some thing active
2016-01-18 15:43:43	Calmoto1	lots of smalls hold sov finally only because nobody gives a fuck about it anymore
2016-01-18 15:43:46	Calmoto1	rip in peace
2016-01-18 15:44:21	gigiarc	people still care about sov
2016-01-18 15:44:25	brainfire	i mean garr_khan held a station alone for a while right
2016-01-18 15:44:27	gigiarc	but there are enough systems now
2016-01-18 15:44:35	gigiarc	that you dont actually have to fight for space
2016-01-18 15:44:58	gigiarc	because everyone condensed down into easier to defend empires
2016-01-18 15:45:55	Lilith5	Everyone hates entosising so no point attacking anyone
2016-01-18 15:46:21	+LuciaDenniard	m8
2016-01-18 15:46:27	+LuciaDenniard	have you seen how entosis EVE is right now?
2016-01-18 15:46:36	brainfire	OK, My question is simple. After you remove the skill points to 0 in those skills you no longer want, can you remove the skill from your skillsheet. I do not want a bunch of 0 level skills showing up. Why remove skill points if you can not remove the skill itself. Please answer this CCP.
2016-01-18 15:46:42	brainfire	great feedback fcon
2016-01-18 15:46:49	Lilith5	probably by like certain people

2016-01-18 15:47:47	+LuciaDenniard	ye
2016-01-18 15:48:04	gigiarc	you actually need several people
2016-01-18 15:48:10	gigiarc	or the node regen will beat you
2016-01-18 15:48:14	brainfire	that's across 15 regions right now
2016-01-18 15:48:15	gigiarc	if you're the attacker
2016-01-18 15:48:34	gigiarc	you cant take sov with a single person now
2016-01-18 15:48:37	Lilith5	Its a horrible system that makes no sence anyway

2016-01-18 15:49:20	brainfire	are sov fights really any different as a result?
2016-01-18 15:49:31	+LuciaDenniard	yes, there aren't any
2016-01-18 15:49:47	brainfire	interesting
2016-01-18 15:50:04	Lilith5	Russians are fighting a lot I think
2016-01-18 15:50:08	brainfire	not even enough to say if they were happening, if they would be different?
2016-01-18 15:50:13	+LuciaDenniard	they have a fight
2016-01-18 15:50:15	Lilith5	in the drone regions
2016-01-18 15:50:16	+LuciaDenniard	then the winner entosises
2016-01-18 15:50:22	+LuciaDenniard	because the other side can't be arsed
2016-01-18 15:51:01	brainfire	even in the part where it gets spread through the constellation - do people basically just form two big blobs, mash uglies, then decide who the winner was and leave?
2016-01-18 15:51:58	Lilith5	usually you just have to rape cage people while you have an alt entosising

2016-01-18 15:52:34	Lilith5	yuck

2016-01-18 17:47:04	MadzNegro	i think people just might want to call meth speed so they feel better about doing meth
2016-01-18 17:47:14	charlotteb	yeah that wouldn't surprise me
2016-01-18 17:47:23	charlotteb	that's sort of what i was wondering about in the back of my head
2016-01-18 17:47:30	MadzNegro	but unless the person is missing a few teeth if they say speed they probably just mean some other amphetamine
2016-01-18 17:48:41	charlotteb	i saw someone call drip backdrop the other day

2016-01-18 17:49:48	MadzNegro	i've never really heard any official term for it
2016-01-18 17:49:57	brainfire	we need one of those regional dialect maps
2016-01-18 17:49:58	brainfire	but for drugs
2016-01-18 17:49:59	charlotteb	the official name
2016-01-18 17:50:02	charlotteb	is postnasal drip
2016-01-18 17:50:07	MadzNegro	yeah
2016-01-18 17:50:22	charlotteb	cause i actually had it as a legit problem outside of snorting shit

Normally a rootkit will install itself inside the operating system so that it can operate in privileged mode on the hardware. A "Ring -1" rootkit will instead install itself as the primary operating system and run your original operating system inside the rootkit as a VM, effectively becoming a hypervisor and your operating system will not have even the slightest clue that it's

2016-01-19 11:50:50	Calmoto	and if white people dont even know the obvious justice system and cop racism when its infront of their faces how the fuck are we gonna fight subtle as fuck racism
2016-01-19 11:50:54	Calmoto	nuke all the fucking whities
2016-01-19 11:51:19	WhiteTree	White people being allies and denouncing racism apparently _isnt enough_.
2016-01-19 11:51:44	Calmoto	not enough for me, just noticing the system is racist as fuck isnt enough
2016-01-19 11:51:48	WhiteTree	I think minority cultures within the US assume individual, or even small groups of white people have a lot more social pull than they actually do.
2016-01-19 11:51:49	Calmoto	YTOU HEAR ME WHITEY YOU HEAR ME

2016-01-19 11:56:55	WhiteTree	You could argue that white society is subconsciously responsible for carrying certain ingrained attitudes towards minority classes.
2016-01-19 11:57:14	nartel	whites arent subhuman
2016-01-19 11:57:24	nartel	you're thinking of non white
2016-01-19 11:57:26	WhiteTree	Any society which has a majority population will adopt the values/needs/desires of that majority population as the default state for that society.

2016-01-19 11:58:28	nartel	This has given me all the feels. I am struggling not to cut all of the white people out of my life (kind of hard, given I'm married to a white man) and many of those people are "good white people." They are shocked at racism and racist behavior— so much so they I get links to racist posts on websites because they can't believe how awful white people can be. They then can't understand why I am fucking upset about seeing such triggering imagery. 
2016-01-19 11:58:28	nartel	I live racism. I wake up to it. I deal with the micro-aggressions

2016-01-19 14:09:54	charlotteb	as well as massive amounts of investment and free trade
2016-01-19 14:10:02	Lilith5	it doesnt really work if there is no jobs in either country though
2016-01-19 14:10:10	Lilith5	except like fruit picking

2016-01-19 14:11:11	Lilith5	there are jobs for some people but not really worth doing

2016-01-19 14:15:11	Haquer	there were literally no jobs here for a while

2016-01-19 14:17:52	Lilith5	Not to sound totally racist but a couple of years ago I went to a job agency and it was full of Polish people who could hardly speak English all filling out forms 
2016-01-19 14:18:06	charlotteb	yeah but there's a thing here
2016-01-19 14:18:15	Lilith5	so I said to this guy at the desk where are all these people going?
2016-01-19 14:18:15	charlotteb	polish people were never "stealing" british jobs
2016-01-19 14:18:25	charlotteb	they were doing all the jobs that british people found beneath them
2016-01-19 14:18:27	Lilith5	he didn't say anything 
2016-01-19 14:18:28	Lilith5	lol

2016-01-19 14:19:05	Lilith5	so I said is there any vacancies at a factory cause I heard one of the people talking about a factory in English
2016-01-19 14:19:12	Lilith5	:D
2016-01-19 14:19:28	Lilith5	the guy said oh no no factory jobs
2016-01-19 14:20:12	Haquer	Actually, there ware websites that can allow me (not someone with big knowledge about informatics) know where where that phone/tablet/pc is located [from its MAC address], even if it's disconnected from the internet or doesn't have GPS active.
2016-01-19 14:20:20	Lilith5	was like so obvious all these people were going off to some factory to work for under priced wages and they didn't want English people finding out about it
2016-01-19 14:21:13	Lilith5	wish I had a hidden camera or some thing at the time :D

2016-01-21 15:36:16	@anderton-lauren	i think dr pepper varies by region actually
2016-01-21 15:36:43	@anderton-lauren	Dr Pepper became insolvent in the early 1980s, prompting an investment group to take the company private. Several years later, Coca-Cola attempted to acquire Dr Pepper, but was blocked from doing so by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Around the same time, Seven Up was acquired from Phillip Morris by the same investment company that bailed out Dr Pepper. Upon the failure of the Coca-Cola 
2016-01-21 15:36:43	@anderton-lauren	merger, Dr Pepper and Seven Up merged (creating Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., or DPSU), giving up international branding rights in the process. After the DPSU merger, Coca-Cola obtained most non-US rights to the Dr Pepper name (with PepsiCo taking the Seven Up rights).

2016-01-27 12:26:29	Haquer	no I stayed home
2016-01-27 12:26:36	Haquer	lost some money but w/e didn't have to get out in fucking ice
2016-01-27 12:27:05	Talbrys_work	better than getting in an accident or something, would have lost more money that way

2016-01-27 12:27:30	Haquer	2 other employees ended up staying nights at the station
2016-01-27 12:27:43	Haquer	each one got like $20-$30 extra in their paychecks for it

2016-01-27 12:27:53	Talbrys_work	rip
2016-01-27 12:28:22	Talbrys_work	do you not have health insurance at all or just not from work?

2016-01-27 12:28:36	Haquer	I'm poor, you think I can afford that?
2016-01-27 12:29:13	Talbrys_work	idk, but you probably can't afford if something serious happens and you have to pay med bills in full
2016-01-27 12:29:28	Haquer	exactly
2016-01-27 12:29:45	Haquer	if my boss tried to get me to come in
2016-01-27 12:29:49	Haquer	that's what I would've told him
2016-01-27 12:30:09	Haquer	everyone else at the station has healthcare through their spouses or they make enough to get their own
2016-01-27 12:31:16	Haquer	actually the gm and night shift guy are both old enough for medicaid
2016-01-27 12:32:47	charlotte-work	hi
2016-01-27 12:32:59	charlotte-work	are you talking about how shit it is to be without socialised healthcare
2016-01-27 12:33:44	Badass	tfw cheap healthcare
2016-01-27 12:33:53	Badass	for some reason jordan has a surplus of doctors
2016-01-27 12:34:28	Haquer	oh I can waste my money on 'cheap' healthcar
2016-01-27 12:34:29	Haquer	e
2016-01-27 12:34:40	Haquer	and by healthcare I mean 'catastrophic health insurance'
2016-01-27 12:34:47	Haquer	which for some reason falls under 'healthcare'
2016-01-27 12:34:52	Haquer	so they can force poor people to have some form
2016-01-27 12:35:01	nartel	getting shot was a pre existing condition sorry
2016-01-27 12:35:09	Haquer	$5,000 deductable
2016-01-27 12:35:21	Haquer	and it only pays 25-50% of your co-pays
2016-01-27 12:35:28	Sabine	i should probably get some kind of an insurance while i'm young and have no pre-existing conditions
2016-01-27 12:35:31	Haquer	so basically you pay a fuckton every year
2016-01-27 12:35:35	Sabine	because it's dirt cheap
2016-01-27 12:35:39	Haquer	if you want to use it
2016-01-27 12:35:45	Haquer	 but you can't use it becuase you're poor
2016-01-27 12:35:47	Haquer	america!
2016-01-27 12:35:55	Badass	is it legal to be without insurance in finland Sabine 
2016-01-27 12:36:00	Badass	or are you on ur parents plan
2016-01-27 12:36:02	Sabine	yes

2016-01-27 12:36:20	Haquer	if you're on uhc
2016-01-27 12:36:20	Badass	finland #1
2016-01-27 12:36:24	Haquer	why do you want 
2016-01-27 12:36:26	Haquer	private
2016-01-27 12:36:30	Haquer	other than faster lines I guess?
2016-01-27 12:36:32	Badass	better service probably
2016-01-27 12:36:47	Sabine	private is better service and much faster line for non-life threatening things
2016-01-27 12:37:52	Sabine	and because these insurances also include the insurance companies paying for the time you are unable to work
2016-01-27 12:38:07	Haquer	haha that would never happen in america
2016-01-27 12:38:19	Haquer	they'll instead deny your claim
2016-01-27 12:38:19	Sabine	they are even building their own hospitals where they can in the same place make the decision that "this is covered by insurance" and actually treat you
2016-01-27 12:38:25	Haquer	so the hospital hounds the fuck out of you
2016-01-27 12:38:27	Sabine	to minimize the downtime
2016-01-27 12:38:35	Haquer	and ruin your credit score

It appears there was a mix up with the carrier giving the incorrect PO# to the depot when scheduling and the driver is at the Depot right now with the load.  The Depot is pushing us off until 2/1 since the PO# wasn’t the one listed for delivery."

2016-01-28 15:17:25	Talbrys_work	but I need the product and don't want to risk the carrier fucking it up again so i guess i'll see what i can do
2016-01-28 15:18:03	Talbrys_work	i'd be lying if i said i don't sometimes be like "oh yeah, let me see what i can do" not bother emailing the depot, and like 15 mins later "no sorry they can't fit it in it will have to come in on the new date"

2016-01-28 20:03:52	Talbrys_work	what kind of cat proofing would i have to do to my apt?
2016-01-28 20:07:00	Talbrys_work	ugh

2016-01-28 20:08:00	Talbrys_work	"umm ok"
2016-01-28 20:08:58	Gumpin	Talbrys if you get a costco discount by working at the depot
2016-01-28 20:09:01	Gumpin	you can basically buy the big 40lb bags of cat litter and food things there
2016-01-28 20:09:40	Talbrys_work	i work at the regional office, but the only discount costco employees get is a free executive members ship
2016-01-28 20:09:47	Gumpin	eh
2016-01-28 20:09:47	Talbrys_work	but yeah, i figured that's where i would get the stuff from
2016-01-28 20:10:00	Gumpin	but yeah initial investment is a few hundred bux
2016-01-28 20:10:12	Gumpin	especially if you get it from a shop/shelter and they have an adoption fee
2016-01-28 20:10:15	Gumpin	usually to cover shots
2016-01-28 20:10:22	Gumpin	then you gotta buy the first set of food
2016-01-28 20:10:38	Gumpin	and a place for the cat to scratch/climb all over
2016-01-28 20:10:42	Gumpin	thats like
2016-01-28 20:10:52	Gumpin	90% of keeping your shit from shreaded without declawing

2016-01-28 20:13:10	anderton-lauren	but expensive as fuck
2016-01-28 20:13:18	Gumpin	squirt gun goes farther
2016-01-28 20:13:24	Gumpin	easier to sneak too
2016-01-28 20:13:49	anderton-lauren	if you're truly insane/wasteful with money
2016-01-28 20:14:03	anderton-lauren	you can get an automatic litter box that will flush the shit down the drain for you

2016-01-28 20:18:26	Talbrys_work	anderton-lauren: what about the auto feeder did he figure out?
2016-01-28 20:18:27	Gumpin	only one of my cats ever got that large
2016-01-28 20:18:45	anderton-lauren	he paws up into the dispensing chute
2016-01-28 20:18:55	Gumpin	its really about how the cats were kittens
2016-01-28 20:19:01	anderton-lauren	and if he puts enough pressure in there then the flywheel will rotate
2016-01-28 20:19:03	anderton-lauren	and dispense food
2016-01-28 20:19:18	Gumpin	had 1 barn cat that never got fat, 2 warehouse/outdoorish cats that got fat
2016-01-28 20:19:21	anderton-lauren	making it do that fucks up the feeding schedule too so it won't feed enough next time it's feeding time
2016-01-28 20:19:25	Gumpin	these 2 are one not fat one might be getting lazy
2016-01-28 20:19:28	anderton-lauren	feed/dispense

2016-01-28 20:20:53	Gumpin	no lie
2016-01-28 20:21:09	anderton-lauren	the problem i encounter with those water fountains is that they fuck up and leak and shit after a while

2016-02-03 13:58:20	digi	(pitts) Apollo Fourth-Quarter Profit Falls 69% as Asset Sales Drop - Bloomberg Business
2016-02-03 13:58:58	pitts	Apollo, which aggressively sold private equity holdings from 2011 to 2014 as market prices surged, now has fewer stakes to sell than peers such as Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle Group LP. The exit spree produced big profits for the firm and investors in its funds, while lessening its exposure to subsequent stock-market swoons in August and last month.
2016-02-03 13:58:58	pitts	“Apollo is at the tail end of the harvesting cycle on its legacy private equity funds,” Rob Lee, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a note to clients before the results were announced. In addition, Apollo’s $18.4 billion private equity fund “is still early in its investing cycle” and may not earn performance fees for years, Lee said.
2016-02-03 13:59:46	Sabine	huh
2016-02-03 14:00:37	pitts	what
2016-02-03 14:00:58	pitts	“We do not believe the current share price of Apollo reflects the strength of our business model and growth opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer Leon Black said in the statement.

2016-02-03 14:08:37	Sabine	do you think the price is pretty near whatever is the lowest it can realistically drop to for extended periods unless things go completely wrong
2016-02-03 14:08:46	pitts	yea
2016-02-03 14:09:11	Sabine	google and yahoo don't show before 2011 but the lowest it has been in the last five years is like 10.28 and it was only for a brief period
2016-02-03 14:09:29	pitts	yea they only went public back then
2016-02-03 14:09:48	Sabine	and if i can get during "trough" at current price 8%+ dividend yield then uh
2016-02-03 14:09:57	pitts	yea lol
2016-02-03 14:10:02	pitts	markets are fuckin dumb man

2016-02-03 14:10:12	pitts	the efficient markets hypothesis is bunk
2016-02-03 14:10:44	pitts	value investors couldnt have outperformed for as long as they have if EMH was real
2016-02-03 14:10:50	pitts	at least the "strong" variant of it
2016-02-03 14:12:39	Sabine	even if price doesn't go up at all i'd get 8%+ annual yield
2016-02-03 14:12:53	Sabine	and after a few years the value could literally double

2016-02-03 14:14:06	digi	(pitts) Chairman's Letter - 1996
2016-02-03 14:14:09	pitts	     In our super-cat operation, our customers are insurers that are 
2016-02-03 14:14:09	pitts	exposed to major earnings volatility and that wish to reduce it.  The 
2016-02-03 14:14:09	pitts	product we sell -  for what we hope is an appropriate price -  is our 
2016-02-03 14:14:09	pitts	willingness to shift that volatility to our own books.  Gyrations in 
2016-02-03 14:14:09	pitts	Berkshire's earnings don't bother us in the least:  Charlie and I would 
2016-02-03 14:14:10	pitts	much rather earn a lumpy 15% over time than a smooth 12%.  (After all, our 
2016-02-03 14:14:12	pitts	earnings swing wildly on a daily and weekly basis - why should we demand 
2016-02-03 14:14:14	pitts	that smoothness accompany each orbit that the earth makes of the sun?)  We 
2016-02-03 14:14:16	pitts	are most comfortable with that thinking, however, when we have 
2016-02-03 14:14:18	pitts	shareholder/partners who can also accept volatility, and that's why we 
2016-02-03 14:14:20	pitts	regularly repeat our cautions.
2016-02-03 14:14:47	pitts	the average investor (including the "pros") would rather take the smooth 12%
2016-02-03 14:15:01	Sabine	either you've just master rused me into losing my money or i'm going to make a really good investment
2016-02-03 14:15:36	pitts	i would never ruse about that
2016-02-03 14:16:07	pitts	thats why i say never invest with leverage
2016-02-03 14:16:32	pitts	unless its extremely long dated debt, i.e ur borrowing against ur house and wont have to repay it for 20 years
2016-02-03 14:17:11	pitts	u never want to be a forced seller
2016-02-03 14:17:20	pitts	like so many people were during the crisis
2016-02-03 14:17:33	pitts	(which also creates the opportunity for apollo and their peers)
2016-02-03 14:17:55	Sabine	yeah talking about that, one of my doubts right now actually is that i'm unironically considering becoming a mortgagecuck, and that's kind of hard if all my assets are locked in longer term investments
2016-02-03 14:18:21	Sabine	right now you can get mortgage at below 1.5% total annual interest
2016-02-03 14:18:22	Sabine	like
2016-02-03 14:18:33	Sabine	why the fuck would i pay someone else's loan on an apartment they are renting
2016-02-03 14:18:40	pitts	like if ur gonna buy a house in the next couple of years then probably not a good idea to invest that money 
2016-02-03 14:18:48	Sabine	when i could stuff minimum loan payments into my own real estate
2016-02-03 14:19:00	pitts	but if its not ur house money then whatever
2016-02-03 14:19:37	Sabine	standard here is that you pay 25% upfront and the real estate covers the rest of the loan backing
2016-02-03 14:20:17	pitts	yea
2016-02-03 14:20:40	Sabine	i mean i could get parents back it and if you pay extra banks also allow lower initial payment
2016-02-03 14:24:47	Sabine	in any case isn't it correct thinking that if i take the mortgage, it should be as long term as possible
2016-02-03 14:25:01	Sabine	because the money is so cheap that it's better to just invest as much of savings as possible instead of loan repayments
2016-02-03 14:25:54	Sabine	and if rates start rising too much you can just accelerate it if necessary
2016-02-03 14:26:31	pitts	murica has the 30 year fixed rate mortgage
2016-02-03 14:26:36	pitts	i dont know if anyone else has that
2016-02-03 14:28:07	Sabine	lowest bank marginals for mortgates last year were 0.8% and apparently they might go even lower
2016-02-03 14:28:17	Sabine	and the total interest is bank margin + euribor which is practically 0 right now
2016-02-03 14:28:18	Sabine	lol
2016-02-03 14:28:33	pitts	yea honestly not sure with europe
2016-02-03 14:28:40	Sabine	some banks offer at least 15 years of fixed rates i think, dunno about rates then
2016-02-03 14:28:43	pitts	and tehse guys starting to do negative rates

2016-02-04 11:03:37	+Zoolacratic	During the malaria outbreaks of 19o6 and 1930 McCord noted that Zulus "threw away the [government's] free tablets and came to the dispensary to buy my `blue medicine' cine' at twenty-five cents an ounce" He attributed this to two factors: he prepared pared quinine in a liquid form as Zulus "were accustomed to drinking medicine," and he added methyline blue aniline dye. While this dye had no medicinal properties, it had the visible effect of turning 
2016-02-04 11:03:38	+Zoolacratic	patients' urine blue. This, combined with the terrible taste, convinced African patients that this was strong medicine, which resulted in greater patient compliance. As McCord concludes, "They had no faith in either pills or free treatment, and quinine pills looked to them like a feeble remedy for a powerful sickness.

They seem to fraternize now. They [Africans] looked upon the introduction of the Coolie [Indian] with some little apprehension

2016-02-09 12:58:18	pitts	As this primary season has gone along, a strange sensation has come over me: I miss Barack Obama. Now, obviously I disagree with a lot of Obama’s policy decisions. I’ve been disappointed by aspects of his presidency. I hope the next presidency is a philosophic departure.
2016-02-09 12:58:18	pitts	But over the course of this campaign it feels as if there’s been a decline in behavioral standards across the board. Many of the traits of character and leadership that Obama possesses, and that maybe we have taken too much for granted, have suddenly gone missing or are in short supply.

2016-02-09 12:59:18	Lilith5	or you can buy some one elses spunk from the market (injector) and use that
2016-02-09 12:59:57	Lilith5	think the price is gonna go down to like 500 mil for injector but not sure
2016-02-09 13:00:00	Talbrys_work	tbf tho this is probably going to work out well for mission gankers
2016-02-09 13:00:04	Viva_Miriya	Like I wanna extract skills
2016-02-09 13:00:20	Lilith5	yea
2016-02-09 13:00:21	Viva_Miriya	And lose mining skills and useless shit and get isk back
2016-02-09 13:00:23	Talbrys_work	cause your going to have like, 2 wk old players in officer fit navy bs
2016-02-09 13:00:33	Viva_Miriya	It's not worth it for me to reinject

2016-02-09 13:00:43	Lilith5	you have to have more than 5 mil sp I think
2016-02-09 13:00:48	Viva_Miriya	Uhh
2016-02-09 13:00:53	Viva_Miriya	100mil SP hello
2016-02-09 13:00:59	charlotte-work	hi
2016-02-09 13:01:04	Lilith5	yea I get like 300 k :(
2016-02-09 13:01:07	Lilith5	out of 500
2016-02-09 13:01:14	Viva_Miriya	That's still ok
2016-02-09 13:01:27	Lilith5	lose 200 k sp every time i inject
2016-02-09 13:01:49	Lilith5	like if I wanna train skirmish command I need 2 injectors
2016-02-09 13:01:59	Lilith5	for like 1.2 bil
2016-02-09 13:02:10	Talbrys_work	yeah
2016-02-09 13:02:11	Talbrys_work	but
2016-02-09 13:02:24	Talbrys_work	people who officer pimp their mission bs on month old chars
2016-02-09 13:02:31	Talbrys_work	sell plex like mad
2016-02-09 13:02:39	Talbrys_work	so 1.2bil isn't much for them
2016-02-09 13:03:48	Lilith5	it means like
2016-02-09 13:03:55	Lilith5	your some noob and join horde or some thing
2016-02-09 13:04:01	Lilith5	for leet pvp training
2016-02-09 13:04:11	Lilith5	and they say guys we are gonna start flying drakes
2016-02-09 13:04:39	Lilith5	so you either say train heavy missiles 5 in a month or you buy an injector for 1.2 bil
2016-02-09 13:04:46	Lilith5	well 600 mil
2016-02-09 13:05:05	Lilith5	and immediatly can use heavy missiles
2016-02-09 13:05:23	Lilith5	but if you say a vet in nc. and you wanna fly sleps 
2016-02-09 13:05:27	Lilith5	you ahve to pay 1.2 bil
2016-02-09 13:06:00	Lilith5	I guess as intended since its meant for newbies and not bittervets
2016-02-09 13:06:05	Talbrys_work	http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/53627898.jpg
2016-02-09 13:06:56	eddict	i mean the sp thing is just a way to get down below 100m sp for people 
2016-02-09 13:07:06	eddict	cause if you are up that high you have tons of wasted sp 
2016-02-09 13:08:53	Lilith5	yea 
2016-02-09 13:08:57	Talbrys_work	any idea if you can use one in a super or do you have to be docked?

2016-02-09 13:11:04	Lilith5	but good thing we use missiles and shields in this alliance I'm in :D
2016-02-09 13:11:48	eddict	Viva_Miriya: yes if you just max out subcaps you get past 100m as well 
2016-02-09 13:11:56	Lilith5	Viva_Miriya wasted sp in social and trading skills
2016-02-09 13:11:59	eddict	but how often do you fly every single ship in the game 
2016-02-09 13:12:05	Viva_Miriya	No it's not

2016-02-11 14:13:21	digi	(nartle) Yahoo has made official its first wave of job cuts under a revitalization plan that aims to slash 1,500, or roughly 15%, of positions across a range of departments and titles. : investing
2016-02-11 14:13:53	garr_khan	yahoo should probably just sell off everything and morph into a PE fund
2016-02-11 14:15:06	pitts	they arent good investors
2016-02-11 14:15:17	pitts	they invested in alibaba years ago
2016-02-11 14:15:22	pitts	but that was jerry yang
2016-02-11 14:15:33	pitts	they didnt buy facebook and i think google
2016-02-11 14:15:56	pitts	anyway lots of tech companies have corporate VC arms
2016-02-11 14:16:03	pitts	and its not like thats made them into apple

2016-02-11 14:17:04	garr_khan	didnt they win big on softbank too?
2016-02-11 14:17:42	pitts	they own yahoo japan i think
2016-02-11 14:17:45	pitts	or a big chunk of it
2016-02-11 14:17:47	garr_khan	theyre like prussia or harvard, the army with a state or the hedge fund with a school
2016-02-11 14:17:52	garr_khan	except theyre only accidentally successful
2016-02-11 14:18:02	pitts	yahoo japan is a good asset
2016-02-11 14:18:19	garr_khan	i dont actually know how valuable a brand yahoo is, maybe its good overseas?
2016-02-11 14:18:23	garr_khan	i just dont know anyone that uses it
2016-02-11 14:18:28	pitts	yahoo japan is really good
2016-02-11 14:18:35	pitts	and even regular yahoo gets a ton of traffic
2016-02-11 14:18:38	elusif	i use it when my default browser gets switched to it
2016-02-11 14:18:39	elusif	somehow
2016-02-11 14:18:55	pitts	but its a declining business
2016-02-11 14:19:30	pitts	yahoo needs to sell the alibaba stake and yahoo japan
2016-02-11 14:19:41	pitts	then sell the core business to someone
2016-02-11 14:19:59	pitts	its days as an indepdendent company are numbered
2016-02-11 14:20:42	garr_khan	do companies who are still solvent ever just have a shareholder vote where they say "this isnt viable anymore, were going downhill, lets liquidate while we can still sell assets at a premium"?
2016-02-11 14:21:06	garr_khan	i guess thats just an acquisition
2016-02-11 14:21:20	garr_khan	dumb question
2016-02-11 14:22:02	pitts	maybe nokia qualifies for that
2016-02-11 14:22:10	pitts	by selling it to microsoft
2016-02-11 14:22:17	pitts	which they've now written down
2016-02-11 14:22:31	pitts	but even then it was too late
2016-02-11 14:22:45	pitts	nokia was like an $85 billion company in 2007 or 2008
2016-02-11 14:22:59	pitts	would they have had the foresight to say its all downhill from here
2016-02-11 14:23:03	pitts	unlikely

2016-02-11 14:51:42	Cinomed_workin	no, I was jsut tech support, no one could have prevented it cause Mike Lazaridis was in charge and he jsut didn't get that smart phones were going to become entertainment devices
2016-02-11 14:51:51	Cinomed_workin	he was stuck on it being business only
2016-02-11 14:52:15	Cinomed_workin	no, I am Texan, RIM had their US headquarters in DFW witha  huge call center
2016-02-11 14:52:27	pitts	Mike Lazaridis was at home on his treadmill and watching television when he first saw the Apple iPhone in early 2007. There were a few things he didn’t understand about the product. So, that summer, he pried one open to look inside and was shocked. It was like Apple had stuffed a Mac computer into a cellphone, he thought.
2016-02-11 14:52:38	Cinomed_workin	one thing I will tell you, they paid grteat had excellent benifits and gave me 4 months of pay when they laid me off, I ain't mad
2016-02-11 14:53:00	pitts	To Mr. Lazaridis, a life-long tinkerer who had built an oscilloscope and computer while in high school, the iPhone was a device that broke all the rules. The operating system alone took up 700 megabytes of memory, and the device used two processors. The entire BlackBerry ran on one processor and used 32 MB. Unlike the BlackBerry, the iPhone had a fully Internet-capable browser. That meant it would strain the networks of wireless companies like AT&T Inc., something 
2016-02-11 14:53:00	pitts	those carriers hadn’t previously allowed. RIM by contrast used a rudimentary browser that limited data usage.
2016-02-11 14:53:00	pitts	“I said, ‘How did they get AT&T to allow [that]?’ Mr. Lazaridis recalled in the interview at his Waterloo office. “ ‘It’s going to collapse the network.’ And in fact, some time later it did.”
2016-02-11 14:53:14	Cinomed_workin	Mike was credited with a quote that sums it up for him "There will never be an MP3 player on aa blackberry!"
2016-02-11 14:54:10	pitts	great story
2016-02-11 14:54:16	Cinomed_workin	the other HUGE issue, no one knew how to fucking use blackberrys, for all their security and features, no one in the store understood them for shit, when they introduced the Blackberry ID the store sales usually jsut made up an email which of course breaks everything
2016-02-11 14:54:17	Sabine	lol do you unironically need "permission" from carriers in usa

2016-02-11 14:54:52	pitts	apple took the power away from carriers
2016-02-11 14:54:59	pitts	look at how it launched
2016-02-11 14:55:15	pitts	it wasnt on the number 1 carrier verizon
2016-02-11 14:55:22	pitts	it was on cingular (which became att)
2016-02-11 14:55:32	pitts	thats how apple has entered every market
2016-02-11 14:55:39	pitts	they pick a third place winner

2016-02-11 14:56:06	pitts	and they let the demand for their product bleed the other carriers
2016-02-11 14:56:12	pitts	eventually verizon had to play ball
2016-02-11 14:57:25	pitts	people went from being customer of a wireless carrier, getting whatever phone they pushed to being a customer of the iphone
2016-02-11 14:57:31	pitts	and willing to switch carriers for it
2016-02-11 14:58:15	pitts	thats why apple can do anything it wants when it comes to carriers
