2015-11-12 10:43:12	AprilMuffins	stupid is a subjective and relative term used to put others and yourself down

2015-11-12 10:44:15	Amalynn	Yeah
2015-11-12 10:44:15	Frosty-nee	AprilMuffins: there's a difference between having low self esteem and being self aware
2015-11-12 10:44:20	charlotteb	yeah
2015-11-12 10:44:22	Amalynn	^
2015-11-12 10:44:38	charlotteb	i don't think you're in a position to tell people about their individual self-esteem tbh idk
2015-11-12 10:44:43	AprilMuffins	omg
2015-11-12 10:44:46	charlotteb	thats like a personal thing?
2015-11-12 10:44:46	AprilMuffins	is this real?
2015-11-12 10:44:51	AprilMuffins	someone calls themselves stupid
2015-11-12 10:44:59	AprilMuffins	and I try to convince that they're not
2015-11-12 10:45:05	AprilMuffins	and I get jumped on for it?
2015-11-12 10:45:09	AprilMuffins	you people are too much XD
2015-11-12 10:45:13	charlotteb	if someone says to your face "i do not have low self-esteem" and you go "yeah but you do"
2015-11-12 10:45:14	Frosty-nee	yeah but it was clearly not very serious

2015-11-12 10:46:12	AprilMuffins	fine, whatever ,sorry for trying to instill some positiveness into people
2015-11-12 10:46:19	Helle	Right, appointments with the clinic, they just called me and made 5 of them, 4 psych talks and one to fill in a psych form that is supposed to take 3 hours, for fuck sake, can we move to a more modern model please
2015-11-12 10:46:35	Frosty-nee	rip
2015-11-12 10:46:44	AprilMuffins	Helle: layers much?
2015-11-12 10:46:48	charlotteb	jesus what the fuck
2015-11-12 10:46:50	Helle	first one 22nd of January, so uh, 6 months after my intake
2015-11-12 10:47:03	Frosty-nee	that's a little ridiculous
2015-11-12 10:47:04	Frosty-nee	wtf
2015-11-12 10:47:05	AprilMuffins	why not go ahead and ask you to write a disortation
2015-11-12 10:47:20	Helle	AprilMuffins: I need to write an autobiography
2015-11-12 10:47:27	Helle	AprilMuffins: yep, I had a GP, refer me, that lead to an intake 7 weeks later and now I have these appointments
2015-11-12 10:48:15	charlotteb	Helle: where are you?
2015-11-12 10:48:18	charlotteb	in the world
2015-11-12 10:48:26	Helle	charlotteb: The Netherlands, also known as HELL
2015-11-12 10:48:29	charlotteb	oh shit
2015-11-12 10:48:32	Frosty-nee	ah
2015-11-12 10:48:34	charlotteb	im sorry for your loss
2015-11-12 10:48:37	Frosty-nee	that'd explain it :C
2015-11-12 10:49:26	Helle	"yeah, it's super busy and you live nearby, so we hope you can take these early appointments", well, shit, it wouldn't be super busy if you fixed your diagnosis process
2015-11-12 10:49:38	Helle	and got it out of the 1970s
2015-11-12 10:49:50	Helle	almost everything is stuck in the 1970s at the clinic
2015-11-12 10:50:16	charlotteb	it's slightly less bad in britbong
2015-11-12 10:50:25	charlotteb	but yeah, there's huge queues for trans care and it's like
2015-11-12 10:50:35	charlotteb	yo if you streamlined your SHIT system there wouldn't be????
2015-11-12 10:50:35	Helle	including how endo works and the surgeons (hence, GRS will not be via them), thankfully if they approve FFS, they refer you to another surgeon
2015-11-12 10:51:35	Frosty-nee	one of the few times I'm glad I DON'T live in a more civilized country
2015-11-12 10:51:43	Helle	I still feel like the clinic is so the wrong place for me
2015-11-12 10:51:45	Helle	but I can't afford another route really
2015-11-12 10:52:24	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: What country are you in?
2015-11-12 10:52:27	Frosty-nee	US
2015-11-12 10:52:35	Amalynn	:X
2015-11-12 10:52:43	Amalynn	I love it here
2015-11-12 10:52:44	Helle	Frosty-nee: in the USA you just have the benefit that, if you have coverage, you tend to be able to chose
2015-11-12 10:52:48	Frosty-nee	oh don't get me wrong
2015-11-12 10:52:52	Frosty-nee	I wouldn't actually leave
2015-11-12 10:53:01	Helle	plus some things are just cheaper because people tend to pay for them themselves
2015-11-12 10:53:02	Amalynn	I don't want to live anywhere else
2015-11-12 10:53:04	Frosty-nee	just we're less than civilized in some ways
2015-11-12 10:53:16	Amalynn	Yeah
2015-11-12 10:53:50	Frosty-nee	but yeah, at least I could just call and set up an appointment with my therapist for the next week
2015-11-12 10:53:55	Frosty-nee	when I started seeing her
2015-11-12 10:54:22	Amalynn	I would love to see single-payer healthcare in the states, but in the other countries where it's at, it doesn't work too well
2015-11-12 10:54:33	Helle	Amalynn: we don't even have single payer\
2015-11-12 10:55:13	Frosty-nee	as it is, i'm fortunate, HRT should be covered by insurance, surprisingly
2015-11-12 10:55:15	Amalynn	Helle: lame
2015-11-12 10:55:18	Helle	the situation is that the goverment sets coverage minimums, no insurance covers more then the minimum for trans care and can set terms on where you can use the coverage and there is only a single clinic
2015-11-12 10:55:23	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: mine is
2015-11-12 10:55:43	Amalynn	Helle sweet Jesus
2015-11-12 10:55:46	Helle	the alternative, there are some psychiatrists that can help you, but then you pretty much void the chance of any insurance coverage beyond HRT
2015-11-12 10:56:01	Amalynn	:(
2015-11-12 10:56:03	Frosty-nee	yeah, I was just surprised, wasn't expecting much trans stuff to be covered at all
2015-11-12 10:56:17	Frosty-nee	:C
2015-11-12 10:56:43	Helle	also things like FFS, tracheal shave and even voice surgery are covered, yes, they are covered if you are hideous as shit, else no chance
2015-11-12 10:56:44	AprilMuffins	hardly any of my trans stuff is covered
2015-11-12 10:56:46	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: both of my insurances are from uncle sam
2015-11-12 10:56:49	Helle	you need to be objectively hideous
2015-11-12 10:56:52	AprilMuffins	and I pay for my insurance out of pocket
2015-11-12 10:57:03	AprilMuffins	stupid insurance being useless
2015-11-12 10:57:31	Amalynn	It's better than paying a tax for not having it
2015-11-12 10:57:38	Helle	I pay 1300 euro of insurance a year....
2015-11-12 10:57:41	AprilMuffins	actually no
2015-11-12 10:57:43	Amalynn	Mines free
2015-11-12 10:57:48	AprilMuffins	it would be cheaper for me to pay the fine
2015-11-12 10:58:01	Amalynn	AprilMuffins: You say that...
2015-11-12 10:58:13	AprilMuffins	and I've worked out the math
2015-11-12 10:58:16	Amalynn	But I've seen some of these fines
2015-11-12 10:58:27	Amalynn	And it was more than the insurance
2015-11-12 10:58:40	Amalynn	Which was hiked post ACA
2015-11-12 10:58:42	<--	Tina_H (Tina@unaffiliated/tommo) has quit
2015-11-12 10:58:45	Frosty-nee	I'm poor enough that I get the fine waived :/
2015-11-12 10:58:56	Amalynn	Because the ACA is ridiculous
2015-11-12 10:59:04	Helle	anyway, I just need to save a couple of cars worth.....
2015-11-12 10:59:10	Amalynn	It's a tax >_>
2015-11-12 10:59:20	Amalynn	It's just not a tax on paper
2015-11-12 10:59:36	Frosty-nee	my plan is living on the cheap till I get promoted to assistant manager
2015-11-12 10:59:37	Helle	and pray I can wrangle my insurance company to pay for part of stuff abroad to an equivilent level as here
2015-11-12 10:59:47	Frosty-nee	afterwards still live on the cheap
2015-11-12 10:59:57	Frosty-nee	and i'll be able to afford basically everything in like a year
2015-11-12 11:00:25	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: I'm living on the cheap because I dropped $1000 to move in to this apartment
2015-11-12 11:00:27	Helle	Frosty-nee: yeah, no
2015-11-12 11:00:45	Helle	I am currently a student....
2015-11-12 11:00:51	Frosty-nee	Helle: :C
2015-11-12 11:00:51	AprilMuffins	I pay over $5200 a year for insurance, nothing is covered at the moment except labs, every doctor visit has been out of pocket, 7 visits, $125 a pop so that's $875, prescription isn't covered so that's $20 + $50 a month, x 12 that's $840
2015-11-12 11:00:59	Helle	I get a couple of thousand working freelance, but it's peanuts
2015-11-12 11:01:08	Helle	and I am unsure if I can hold down a full time job at the moment
2015-11-12 11:01:11	AprilMuffins	that's $6915
2015-11-12 11:01:26	AprilMuffins	my penalty woulda been $4896 for not paying insurance
2015-11-12 11:01:36	AprilMuffins	so I woul d save about $300
2015-11-12 11:02:11	Frosty-nee	Amalynn: i'm fortunate that I have family who'll give me cheap rent
2015-11-12 11:02:35	Amalynn	Things should start improving soon
2015-11-12 11:02:45	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: My rent isn't horrid
2015-11-12 11:02:59	Amalynn	That was just a move-in cost
2015-11-12 11:03:08	Frosty-nee	yeah, i've started cutting back a lot recently on spending
2015-11-12 11:03:23	Frosty-nee	did the math, I can get yearly living costs down to like $10k
2015-11-12 11:03:36	Amalynn	Ha, not me
2015-11-12 11:03:43	Amalynn	Because car >_>
2015-11-12 11:04:25	Frosty-nee	car note?
2015-11-12 11:04:31	Frosty-nee	those things suck
2015-11-12 11:04:59	Amalynn	AprilMuffins: a $5000 tax because you don't have insurance is horseshit
2015-11-12 11:06:00	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: It's bullshit that you pretty much have to have one to be successful
2015-11-12 11:06:08	Amalynn	It can be done without
2015-11-12 11:06:20	Amalynn	But its incredibly difficult
2015-11-12 11:07:04	Frosty-nee	Amalynn: yeah, i'm sad because i'm going to have to get something better once my current car decides to explode
2015-11-12 11:07:20	Frosty-nee	and it's going to, that whirring noise in the rear end is getting worse
2015-11-12 11:07:22	Amalynn	Frosty-nee: What do you have?
2015-11-12 11:07:42	Frosty-nee	I bought a 95 mustang with 295k miles on it for like $1500
2015-11-12 11:07:48	Frosty-nee	i'm actually amazed it's lasted 6 months
2015-11-12 11:07:51	Frosty-nee	with no major service
2015-11-12 11:07:53	Amalynn	Did you know the average American spends $9000 a year just on their car?
2015-11-12 11:08:25	Amalynn	You should probably get that looked at x.x
2015-11-12 11:08:31	Amalynn	Mine was $800
2015-11-12 11:08:45	Amalynn	Its an 02 intrepid
2015-11-12 11:08:57	Amalynn	Has like 173000 miles on it
2015-11-12 11:09:02	Frosty-nee	oh I know what's wrong
2015-11-12 11:09:12	Frosty-nee	bearing in the diff is going
2015-11-12 11:09:13	Amalynn	What?
2015-11-12 11:09:19	Amalynn	O.o
2015-11-12 11:09:38	Amalynn	You should get that fixed
2015-11-12 11:09:41	Frosty-nee	but it's not catastrophic yet, so meh
2015-11-12 11:10:03	Amalynn	With bearings, eventually it just stops
2015-11-12 11:10:47	Frosty-nee	yeah, I just never have time
2015-11-12 11:10:56	Frosty-nee	I very rarely get two days off in a row
2015-11-12 11:12:30	Amalynn	I would cooperate with a friend or coworker to get that remedied
2015-11-12 11:12:45	MrDante|mobile	What are days off?
2015-11-12 11:12:48	Amalynn	Before the vehicle just stops moving
2015-11-12 11:12:54	Amalynn	MrDante|mobile: right?
2015-11-12 11:13:19	Frosty-nee	MrDante|mobile: i'm sure they'd have me in every day if they could
2015-11-12 11:13:33	Frosty-nee	some silly law thing prevents that though :P
2015-11-12 11:13:55	MrDante|mobile	The law says amazon can only make me work 60 hours a week max
2015-11-12 11:14:02	charlotteb	60
2015-11-12 11:14:04	charlotteb	jesus
2015-11-12 11:14:32	Amalynn	MrDante|mobile: o.o
2015-11-12 11:14:54	Amalynn	I work 40, so I'm right behind you
2015-11-12 11:15:06	MrDante|mobile	I also go to school Amalynn
2015-11-12 11:15:16	MrDante|mobile	Mon-thurs after work
2015-11-12 11:15:17	Amalynn	MrDante|mobile: ew
2015-11-12 11:15:24	Amalynn	I don't envy you
2015-11-12 11:15:31	AprilMuffins	the ONLY complain I have about my job is salary means I can work 80 hours a week and only get paid for 40
2015-11-12 11:15:33	AprilMuffins	granted
2015-11-12 11:15:34	MrDante|mobile	Work 6am-4pm school 530-700
