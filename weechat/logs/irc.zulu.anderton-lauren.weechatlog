2016-02-02 10:13:41	anderton-lauren	ooops

2016-02-02 10:15:50	charlotte-work	lots of blood tests and that
2016-02-02 10:16:05	charlotte-work	i think weight loss is very important just to avoid DVT complications
2016-02-02 10:16:31	charlotte-work	also u can't redistribute fat that already exists which is lameo
2016-02-02 10:16:33	anderton-lauren	i am literally like

2016-02-02 10:18:29	anderton-lauren	so
2016-02-02 10:18:32	anderton-lauren	not losing weight
2016-02-02 10:18:42	charlotte-work	swimming is definitely good
2016-02-02 10:18:49	charlotte-work	but it fucking kicks the shit out of you if you're unfit
