2015-10-30 16:58:29	charlotteb1	hey, just out of interest, what's the reason you won't join that channel? is there something I should know about it?
2015-10-30 17:00:10	Ulrike	I'm asexual. The channel is over sexualized. Or at least was when I spent a lot of time in there. No one respected anyone else's boundaries. Plus there are multiple people in there that, imo, should have been banned long ago. One of them had told me to go kill myself multiple times.
2015-10-30 17:00:29	charlotteb1	wow
2015-10-30 17:00:43	charlotteb1	yeah okay i got that over-sexualised vibe
2015-10-30 17:00:45	charlotteb1	for sure
2015-10-30 17:00:51	charlotteb1	but the rest of it i had no idea about
2015-10-30 17:00:56	charlotteb1	gonna remove it from my list probably
2015-10-30 17:01:35	charlotteb1	the name of the channel unsettled me to begin with tbh, has those strange fetishistic connotations
2015-10-30 17:03:02	Ulrike	Well the name initially came from the original owner of the channel. But she allowed it to quickly devolve into a fetishist channel. Or at least that's how I've always seen it.
2015-10-30 17:04:07	charlotteb1	that's really quite grim
2015-10-30 17:05:05	charlotteb1	cause yeah, that's the sort of subset of trans people that i really try to disassociate myself from
2015-10-30 17:05:08	charlotteb1	makes me super uncomfortable
2015-10-30 17:06:06	Ulrike	Mmhmm
2015-10-30 17:08:03	charlotteb1	thanks for the info anyway
2015-10-30 17:08:09	charlotteb1	~changing my behavior~
2015-10-30 17:09:10	Ulrike	No problem
