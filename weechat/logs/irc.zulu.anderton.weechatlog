2015-11-10 12:22:08	anderton	[ I am a strong supporter of Transfolk, which is why I find this whole Caitlyn Jenner thing so idiotic, it makes Trans people look like they need hand outs and made up awards. Seriously, putting on a dress and talking about yourself on TV isn't really helping Transfolk it's helping yourself, which is something the Jenners/Kardashians seem good at if nothing else. ]
